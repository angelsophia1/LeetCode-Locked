Question:
Given a nested list of integers, return the sum of all integers in the list weighted by their depth.

Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

Example 1:

Input: [[1,1],2,[1,1]]
Output: 10 
Explanation: Four 1's at depth 2, one 2 at depth 1.
Example 2:

Input: [1,[4,[6]]]
Output: 27 
Explanation: One 1 at depth 1, one 4 at depth 2, and one 6 at depth 3; 1 + 4*2 + 6*3 = 27.
