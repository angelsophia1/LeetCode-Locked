Qestion:

There is a special keyboard with all keys in a single row.

Given a string keyboard of length 26 indicating the layout of the keyboard (indexed from 0 to 25), initially your finger is at index 0. To type a character, you have to move your finger to the index of the desired character. The time taken to move your finger from index i to index j is |i - j|.

You want to type a string word. Write a function to calculate how much time it takes to type it with one finger.

Example 1:

Input: keyboard = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", word = "cba"
Output: 4
Explanation: The index moves from 0 to 2 to write 'c' then to 1 to write 'b' then to 0 again to write 'a'.
Total time = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4. 

Example 2:

Input: keyboard = "pqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmno", word = "leetcode"
Output: 73

Constraints:

1.keyboard.length == 26
2.keyboard contains each English lowercase letter exactly once in some order.
3.1 <= word.length <= 10^4
4.word[i] is an English lowercase letter.

    int current = 0;
    int res = 0;
    foreach(char c in test)
    {
        current = keyboard.IndexOf(c);
        res += Math.Abs(current - prev);
        prev = current;
    }
    Console.WriteLine(res);
  }
}
